Welcome to BookFLIX, our online library database.

Here you will be prompted to look at our curation of top 10 rated books (to see them type y or Y when prompted, else any character)

Our main menu features
- a search menu to find books with specific genres or titles (for easy testing, e.g. look through "genre" when asked the category you would like to search, and type in genres like "Romance" or "Travel" to find books within that category)
- another feature is a quiz that matches you with books based on what you are looking for, our compatibility quiz
    here, it will prompt you with directions, follow them and it will generate 20 books that we recommend to you based on your answers

Hope you enjoy using our platform, and happy reading! :)
